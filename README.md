### ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME

- **Importing the `random` Module:**
    - `import random`: Imports the `random` module, needed to generate a random computer choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
  
- **Defining the `get_user_choice()` Function:**
    - `def get_user_choice():`: Defines the function that handles user input.
    - Prompts the user to input their choice and validates it to ensure it's either "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
  
- **Defining the `get_computer_choice()` Function:**
    - `def get_computer_choice():`: Defines the function that generates a random computer choice using `random.choice()`.

- **Defining the `determine_winner()` Function:**
    - `def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):`: Defines the function that compares the user's and computer's choices and determines the winner.
    - Includes conditional checks to decide the outcome based on the game’s rules.

- **Defining the `play_round()` Function:**
    - `def play_round():`: Handles the logic for a single round of the game.
    - Calls the `get_user_choice()` and `get_computer_choice()` functions and uses `determine_winner()` to display the result.

- **Main Game Loop (`play_game()`):**
    - Initializes a scoring system to track the user's and computer's wins.
    - Runs an infinite loop, repeatedly playing rounds until the user decides to stop.
    - Asks the user if they want to continue after each round.

- **User Input Validation:** Ensures that only valid choices are accepted (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **Random Computer Choice:** Uses `random.choice()` to make the computer’s choice.
- **Game Logic:** Determines the winner using if-elif-else statements based on the game rules.
- **Scorekeeping:** Tracks the score for both the player and the computer.
- **Replay Option:** Asks the user if they want to continue after each round.

### **Possible Enhancements:**
- Add a scoring system with a win/loss ratio.
- Implement advanced features like difficulty levels or extra choices (e.g., "Lizard", "Spock").
- Create a GUI with a library like Tkinter or Pygame.
- Allow the user to set a custom number of rounds or a target score.

This version of the game is simple but can be expanded with more features for a richer experience!
